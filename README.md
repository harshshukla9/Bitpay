Technical Overview:
Frontend:
Built with React for a modern, dynamic user interface.
React Router manages routes like /signup, /signin, /dashboard, and /send.
Button actions utilize useNavigate for seamless navigation between components.
Styled using utility classes for responsiveness (e.g., bg-blue-600, hover:bg-blue-700).
Backend:
Developed with Node.js and Express for handling API endpoints.
APIs handle authentication, transaction processing, and user account management.
Database:
MongoDB serves as the database to store user data, transaction records, and other essential information.
Planned User Flow:
User lands on the Home Page.
Clicks "Get Started" and is redirected to the Signin page.
Signs in or creates an account via the Signup page.
Gains access to the Dashboard for managing crypto transactions.
Uses the Send Money feature to initiate transactions.
This MERN-based platform demonstrates a robust architecture for building scalable, user-friendly crypto applications. It can be further expanded to include features like transaction history, wallet integration, and real-time crypto analytics.
